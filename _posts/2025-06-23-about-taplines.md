Hi, I'm Stormy. I read “My Side of the Mountain” and “The Mysterious Island” as a kid and have always been fascinated with a diy approach to civilization: #camping, #gardening, #hamradio, and #brewing.

After studying chemistry, I’ve spent the last twenty five years in IT, first as a #Web1.0 programmer and #sysop during the 90’s, then in #itsupport and #dataanalyst roles this century. 

Taplines can be a lot of things--conduits for beer, filters in synthesizers and radios, even musical delay effects. I'm just getting started, but I expect this tapline will deliver short echoes on all of these topics.
